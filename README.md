<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Description
A flashcard app that allows users to create virtual flashcards with words and definitions in order to study for their classes. Fuctionality wise, it would be very similar to Quizlet, where users can study words and prepare for a quiz or exam.

The primary audience for the app are students who are studying for quizzes or exams, or people wishing to learn new vocabs or concepts. 

For best practice, we take advantage of Junit tests to gauge the correctness of the codes implemented. In order to maintain effective communication between group members, we created a group chat for people to ask and answer questions. We also hosted Zoom meetings regulary to discuss and address problems and challenges that we encountered along the way. 



<!-- Project Iterations -->
## Project Iterations
### Iteration 1:
#### What user stories were completed this iteration?

We designed a basic command-line UI for the menu, including many placeholder sections like viewing sets and adding sets models. Users can choose to create a new study set and change the name of the study set. In addition, users can add words, definitions to the study set and view all the terms in the study set. Users can also modify terms and delete terms in a specific study set. To better manage the study set, we created a set manager responsible for managing study sets.

#### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
We plan to add more modes to the app. For example, we would like to create a flashcard mode where the user can study each term individually. We also need to refactor the app so that it could store the data (study set etc.) created by the user locally and allow them to access these data the next time they run the program.  

#### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
There is one task in which the user should be able to select a study set to study. We need to allow the program to run continuously (meaning programs stops after the user add/open a set). One possible solution for this is to add a quit button to stop the program from running continuously.

#### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)?
We're still trying to implement this.
