<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Description
A flashcard app that allows users to create virtual flashcards with words and definitions in order to study for their classes. The functionalities would be very similar to a quizlet for users to study words and students to prepare for a quiz or exam.

Students who are preparing for a quiz or exam for classes that they are in and Anyone wishing to learn or memorize new vocabs or concepts can choose to utilize our implemented flashcard app.

For best practice, we take advantage of Junit tests to test the accuracy of implemented code, Git specifically version control to manage the progress of our projects. We also created discussion group to talk about the problem and challenge of project during implementing code. At the same time, if anyone has questions or problems, we set up zoom meeting to talk about it.


<!-- Project Iterations -->
## Project Iterations
Iteration 1:
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)?
