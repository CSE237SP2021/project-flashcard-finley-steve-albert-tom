<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Description
A flashcard app that allows users to create virtual flashcards with words and definitions in order to study for their classes. The functionalities would be very similar to a quizlet for users to study words and students to prepare for a quiz or exam.

Students who are preparing for a quiz or exam for classes that they are in and Anyone wishing to learn or memorize new vocabs or concepts can choose to utilize our implemented flashcard app.

For best practice, we take advantage of Junit tests to test the accuracy of implemented code, Git specifically version control to manage the progress of our projects. We also created discussion group to talk about the problem and challenge of project during implementing code. At the same time, if anyone has questions or problems, we set up zoom meeting to talk about it.


<!-- Project Iterations -->
## Project Iterations
Iteration 1:
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)?

What user stories were completed this iteration? 

We design a basic command-line UI for the menu, including many placeholder sections, specifically View sets and add sets models. Users can choose to create a new study set and modify the name of the study set. Not only that, users can add words, definitions to the study set and view all the studying terms on the study set. Users can also be able to modify terms and delete terms on the specific study set. To better manage the study set, we create the set manager responsible for managing study sets.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

There is one task in which the user should be able to select a study set to study. We need to allow the program to run continuously (meaning programs stops after the user add/open a set). The way for us to solve this is to adding a quit button to stop the program run continuously.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)?
